Brigade Extended - Building Gateways, Writing Secrets, and Storage examples.

You've seen Brigade, now let's expand its capabilities. Gateways are the principle event pathway into Brigade. Out of the box you get GitHub and DockerHub gateway. There is a world of possible trigger sources that we all could contribute a gateway for. We will review a couple basic examples, GitLab and BitBucket. We will close with an Object Storage example for persisting typically ephemeral Brigade Job data.
